I used Sinatra
- [x] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database
I used ActiveRecord and inherited from both Migrations and Base classes
- [x] Include more than one model class (list of model class names e.g. User, Post, Category)
Models = User, Medicine

User has an account and their password is authenticated on login

Medicine can be created with the new route/form, read with the show.erb, updated with the edit route/form, and destroyed with the delete route/form
